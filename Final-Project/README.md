# Final Project
###  This is my final-task after learning html & css.

## Why?
#### Creating a responsive website for a restaurant can be a great way to increase online visibility and attract new customers. By ensuring that the website looks great and functions well on all devices, you can make a good impression and encourage people to visit your establishment.

## Project Design 

#### There are a few things to keep in mind when creating a responsive restaurant website. First, the design should be clean and simple. Too much clutter can be confusing and off-putting, so it’s important to focus on the essentials. Second, the website should be easy to navigate. All the important information should be easy to find, and users should be able to move around without getting lost. Finally, the website should be optimizer for mobile devices. This means that it should load quickly and be easy to use on a small screen.

##### If you keep these things in mind, you can create a responsive restaurant website that looks great, functions well, and attracts new customers.
